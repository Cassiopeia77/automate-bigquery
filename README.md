# automate-bigquery
Templates to allow BigQuery automation via Shell.

These templates can be executed via Shell to allow queries to be run, and tables to be created/appended in BigQuery without manually running.

Simply upload to your folder for any Linux machine and set up a crontab for each template.

Changes and comments all welcomed.
